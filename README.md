## Logistic Regression | Day 5
Moving forward into #100DaysOfMLCode today I dived into the deeper depth of what actually Logistic Regression is and what is the math involved behind it. Learned how cost function is calculated and then how to apply gradient descent algorithm to cost function to minimize the error in prediction.  
Due to less time I will now be posting a infographic on alternate days.
Also if someone wants to help me out in documentaion of code and has already some experince in the field and knows Markdown for github please contact me on LinkedIn :) .

## Math Behind Logistic Regression | Day 8 

#100DaysOfMLCode To clear my insights on logistic regression I was searching on the internet for some resource or article and I came across this article (https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-detailed-overview-46c4da4303bc) by Saishruthi Swaminathan. 

It gives a detailed description of Logistic Regression. Do check it out.

## Support Vector Machines | Day 9
Got an intution on what SVM is and how it is used to solve Classification problem.

## SVM and KNN | Day 10
Learned more about how SVM works and implementing the knn algorithm.

## Implementation of K-NN | Day 11  

Implemented the K-NN algorithm for classification. #100DaysOfMLCode 
Support Vector Machine Infographic is halfway complete will update it tomorrow.

## Naive Bayes Classifier | Day 13

Continuing with #100DaysOfMLCode today I went through the Naive Bayes classifier.
I am also implementing the SVM in python using scikit-learn. Will update the code soon.

## Implementation of SVM | Day 14
Today I implemented SVM on linearly related data. Used Scikit-Learn library. In scikit-learn we have SVC classifier which we use to achieve this task. Will be using kernel-trick on next implementation.
Check the code [here](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code/blob/master/Code/Day%2013%20SVM.md).

## Naive Bayes Classifier and Black Box Machine Learning | Day 15
Learned about diffrent types of naive bayes classifer also started the lectures by [Bloomberg](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#home). first one in the playlist was Black Box Machine Learning. It gave the whole over view about prediction functions, feature extraction, learning algorithms, performance evaluation, cross-validation, sample bias, nonstationarity, overfitting, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Implemented SVM using Kernel Trick | Day 16
Using Scikit-Learn library implemented SVM algorithm along with kernel function which maps our data points into higher dimension to find optimal hyperplane. 

## Started Deep learning Specialization on Coursera | Day 17
Completed the whole Week 1 and Week 2 on a single day. Learned Logistic regression as Neural Network. 

## Deep learning Specialization on Coursera | Day 18
Completed the Course 1 of the deep learning specialization. Implemented a neural net in python.

## The Learning Problem , Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa | Day 19
Started Lecture 1 of 18 of Caltech's Machine Learning Course - CS 156 by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa. It was basically an intoduction to the upcoming lectures. He also explained Perceptron Algorithm.

## Started Deep learning Specialization Course 2 | Day 20
Completed the Week 1 of Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization.

## Web Scraping | Day 21
Watched some tutorials on how to do web scaping using Beautiful Soup in order to collect data for building a model.

## Is Learning Feasible? | Day 22

## Jumped To Brush up Linear Algebra | Day 26
Found an amazing [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) on youtube 3Blue1Brown. It has a playlist called Essence of Linear Algebra. Started off by completing 4 videos which gave a complete overview of Vectors, Linear Combinations, Spans, Basis Vectors, Linear Transformations and Matrix Multiplication. 

Link to the Playlist [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
